# Clauses
## What are clauses?
1. Definition
    * A clause is a group of words that consists of a subject and a predicate. There are two major types of clauses: Independent clauses, Dependent clauses
2. Independent clauses
    * An indpendent clause, also called a main clause, is like a sentence. It consits of a subject and a predicate and can stand alone like a sentence.
3. Dependent clauses
    * A dependent clause, also called subordinate clause, has a subject and a verb but, unlike a independent clause, it cannot stand alone as a sentence.

## The Sentence
1. Definition
    * In grammar, a sentence is the basic grammatical unit. It contains a group of words and expresses a complete thought.
    * A sentence consists of a `subject` and a `predicate`. For example in the sentence "Bill writes good poems" Bill is the subject of the sentence and writes good poems is the predicate.
2. Types of sentences:
    * Declarative sentence
        * Applicants will be answered in due time. (It makes a statement.)

2. Two types of adjective clauses:
    * Restrictive / Defining Clauses
        * Restrictive clauses give essential information about the noun. These clauses don't require commas.
        * E.g., The man who is standing there is a secret agent.
    * Non-restrictive / non-defining clauses
        * Non-restrictive clauses give extra or non-essential information about the noun. __These clauses require commas.__
        * E.g, Fast food, which most people love, is not very healthy at all.

## Adverb Clauses
1. Definition

    * An adverb clause is a dependent clause (or subordinate clause) which functions as an adverb.
2. Types of adverb clauses
    Type | Example

## Noun Clauses
1. Definition:

## Relative Clauses
1. Definition
    * A relative clause is a subordinate clause that modifies a noun or a noun phrase.

2. Relative clauses can be introduced by:
    * A relative pronoun: who, whom, which, that, whose.
    * A relative adverb: where, why and when.
    * None of them.
        * Example: "The man I met is extremely wealthy"
3. Subject pronoun or object pronoun?
    * If the relative pronoun is not followed by a noun or pronoun, it is a subject pronoun. __Subject relative pronouns can never be omitted (dropped.)__
        * Example:
            * The apple which is lying on the table is sweet.
            * The teacher who lives next door is nice.

## Appositive Clauses
1. Definition
    * An appositive is a noun or a noun phrase placed next to another word to define or modify it.

    * Non-restrictive appositives are not crucial to the meaning of the sentence.
        * "Alan, the chief executive of the project, has just called for a meeting ", "the chief executive of the project" doesn't narrow down the first element "Alan". It rather provides additional information about it. Non-restrictive appositives are put between commas.
    * In a restrictive appositive, the second element limits or clarifies a word in some crucial way.
        * "my friend Leila writes good poems ", the name " Leila" tells us which friend the speaker is talking about and is thus restrictive. Restrictive appositives don't need to be set off with a pair of commas.

            2. Or if and were placed between them.
    * Cumulative Adjectives
        * When adjectives pile up to jointly describe the noun and need to be arranged in a specific order, they are called cumulative adjectives. No commas are needed to separate the adjectives.
