    Dear Manager,

    I am writing to express my disappointment regarding a recent shopping experience at your store. On December 3rd, I purchased a music player that I **intended** to give as a birthday gift to my sister. Unfortunately, the device did not work when I attempted to play the music that my sister **enjoys the most**.

    The equipment fails to turn on **despite** several attempts to get it to work, and I followed the instructions in the manual **with no success**. I contacted the shop by phone to explain the situation and request a refund or replacement, but the customer service representative I spoke to was unhelpful and did not take any action to address my issue. I left the conversation feeling frustrated and dissatisfied with the service provided.

    If no action is taken to address my issue, I will have to take this matter further. **As** my sister's birthday **is approaching**, I request that you replace the faulty equipment **promptly** as I do not want to waste any time finding an **alternative** gift for her.

    Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

    Sincerely,

    Jemmy

1. magazine

    Assess this IETLS writing.

    The task is:

    You have just read an article in an international travel magazine which contained some information about your town that is incorrect.

    Write a letter to the editor of the magazine. In your letter
    • correct the information in the article
    • explain why it is important for the magazine to give correct information
    • suggest what the magazine should do about this situation

    my writing:

    Dear Sir or Madam,

    I'm writing to offer some advice on the article which was published on 11 January about the history of Xi'an, and named A brief history of Xi'an. The article says that only 10 dynasties built capital at Xi'an while true number is 13.

    As we all know, Xi'an is very ancient city with history over thousands of years. And it's famous for tourist attractions, such as Dayan Tower, Huaqing Pool, Terracotta Warriors. It's hard to believe there is incorrect information introducing Xi'an. It's not only a matter of number but also professional skill of the magazine. What more important is that it expresses wrong information to tourists and misleads them to know this ancient and beautiful city.

    It's known to us that avoiding all mistakes is impossible. I have read the magazine over 5 years and this is my first time finding mistake. I would like you to issue a correction in a future edition or online, and perhaps offer to provide additional information or resources for accurate reporting in the future. And you may also take steps to ensure that similar mistakes do not happen in the future.

    I hope this information can be truly helpful for you.

    Sincerely,
    Jemmy

    I am writing to inform you that an article about my hometown which was recently published on Trip Advisor magazine contained some false information.

    I read the complete article thoroughly. Since you wrote regarding our culture and customs, I found it quite interesting. I would like to express my gratitude **for the same**. However, the information related to the climate of our city was incorrect. You stated that the maximum temperature reaches up to 45 degree, which is not true. In fact, our city does not get hotter than 28 degree in summers. It is important to **portray** the true picture of a town in travel magazines **as** false information can **adversely affect** the tourism industry. Moreover, fake information can **negatively affect** the reputation of our hometown.

    I am humbly requesting you to correct the information and republish it in your future prints. **In addition to** this it would be great if you could add a footnote stating that the given information was false.

    I am looking forward to a quick resolution to this important matter.

    **ChatGPT**

    I am writing to express my concerns regarding a recent article in your magazine about my town, which contains some incorrect information. The article claims that our town has only been in existence for 50 years, **when in fact** it has a rich history **dating back several centuries**.

    It is crucial for travel magazines like yours to provide accurate and reliable information to your readers. People rely on your magazine to plan their trips and make informed decisions about where to go and what to do. Misinformation can **not only** mislead tourists, **but also** **negatively impact** the local economy and community.

    I suggest that the magazine issue a correction in your next edition, stating the correct history and background of the town. **In addition**, you could consider publishing a feature article that highlights the town's cultural and historical significance, which could **help to** promote tourism and educate readers.

    Thank you for taking the time to read my letter, and I hope you will take my suggestions into consideration.
