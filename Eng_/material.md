# Marine Ecosystem

What’s interesting is that overfishing isn’t the `main agent` of the decline, as we might assume.

Pollution fuels a process known as `eutrophication`, which kills certain sea grasses. `Nutrients` such as `nitrogen` and `phosphorus` contained in human and industrial waste promote the growth of tiny `phytoplankton`. This over-enrichment of the sea can ultimately lead to the collapse of the entire system through oxygen starvation.

By contrast, North Sea cod has `withstood` very heavy fishing for hundreds of years.

His theory is `backed up` by evidence from experiments into how ecosystem react to change.

# OUT OF THE ASHES

A On the afternoon of 30th August 1989, fire broke out at Uppark, a large eighteenth-century house in Sussex. For a year builders had been replacing the `lead` on the roof, and by a `stroke of irony`, were due to finish the next day, on August 31st. Within fifteen minutes of the alarm being sounded, the `fire brigade` had arrived on the scene, though nothing was to survive of the priceless collection on the first floor `apart from` an oil painting of a dog which the firemen `swept up` as they finally `retreated` from the `blaze`. But due to the courage and swift action of the previous owners, the Meade-Featherstonhaugh family, and the staff, stewards and visitors to the house, who formed human chains to pass the precious pieces of `porcelain`, furniture and paintings out onto the `lawn`, 95 percent of the contents from the ground floor and the basement were saved. As the fire continued to `rage`, the National Trust’s `conservators` were being `mobilised`, and that evening local `stationers` were especially opened to provide the bulk supplies of `blotting` paper so `desperately` needed in the `salvage` operation.

B The following morning, Uppark stood open to the sky. A `sludge` of wet `charcoal` covered the ground floor and basement, and in every room `charred` and fallen `timbers` lay amongst the smoke. It was a scene of `utter` `devastation`.

C After the initial sense of shock, the days which followed the fire were filled with discoveries. Helped by volunteers, the National Trust’s `archaeologists` and conservators `swung into` action, first of all marking the site out into a grid and then salvaging everything down to the last door handle. The position of each fragment was recorded, and all the `debris` was stored in countless `dustbins` before being `sifted` and categorised.

D There was great excitement as `remnants` of the `lantern` from the `Staircase` Hall were pulled out from the debris of two fallen floors, and also three weeks later when the Red Room `carpet`, thought to have been totally lost, was found wrapped around the remains of a piano. There was a lucky `reprieve` for the State Bed too. Staff who had left the scene at 3am on the night of the fire had thought its loss was `inevitable`, but when they returned the next morning it had escaped largely undamaged. Firemen, directed by the National Trust’s conservators from outside the Tapestry Room window, `dismantled` the `silk`-hung bed and passed it out piece by piece. Twenty minutes later the ceiling fell in.

E The scale of the task to repair Uppark was `unprecedented` in the National Trust. The immediate question was whether it should be done at all. A decision had to be taken quickly, as the building was `unsound` and whatever had not been damaged by the fire was exposed to the elements. Within a month, after consulting many experts and with the agreement of the National Trust’s Executive Committee, the restoration programme began. It was `undertaken` for three main reasons. `After the fire it had become apparent just how much remained of the structure with its splendidly decorated interiors`; to have pulled the house down, as one `commentator` suggested, would have been vandalism. Also the property was covered by insurance, so the repairs would not `call(要求) upon` the National Trust’s own funds. Lastly, much had been saved of the fine collection acquired especially for Uppark from 1747 by Sir Matthew Featherstonhaugh and his son Harry. These objects belonged nowhere else, and complete restoration of the house would allow them to be seen and enjoyed again in their original setting.

F The search for `craftsmen` and women capable of doing the `intricate` restoration work was nation-wide. Once the quality and skill of the individual or company had been `ascertained`, they had to pass an economic test, as every job was competitively `tendered` 竞争性招标. This has had `enormous` benefits because not only have a number of highly skilled people `come to the fore` - `woodcarvers` for example, following in the foot steps of Grinling Gibbons - but many of them, for example `plasterers`, have relearnt the skills of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries which can now be of use to other country house owners when the need arises.

G In June 1994 the building programme was completed, on time and on budget. The total cost of the work to repair the house and its contents came to be nearly ~20 million, largely met from insurance. In addition, it made economic sense for the National Trust to `invest` time and money in upgrading water and heating systems, installing modern environmental controls, and updating fire and security equipment.

H The final stages of restoration and the massive programme of reinstallation took eight months. The family and the room stewards were visibly moved when returning to their old `haunts`, perhaps the best testament that the spirit of Uppark had not died. But the `debate` will no doubt continue as to whether or not it was right to repair the house after the fire. The National Trust has done its best to remain true to Uppark; it is for others to judge the success of the project.

Note: The National Trust is a `charitable` organisation in Britain set up over a hundred years ago to preserve the national `heritage`.

# THE WATER CRISIS

Simple changes could improve the rate `substantially`, though it is unrealistic to expect very high levels of water-use efficiency in many developing countries, faced as they are with a `chronic lack of capital` and a largely untrained `rural` workforce.

With domestic and agricultural demands also increasing, the capacity of water supply systems `is under growing strain.`

In addition, huge quantities of water are consumed because used water from `sewage pipes`, `storm drains` and factories is merely flushed away and discharged into rivers or the sea.

# Labrador

Several hundred pieces of baggage are **rushed** from the plane onto a **conveyor belt** in the **baggage reclaim annexe**. Over the sound of **roaring** engines, rushing air vents and grinding generators, a dog barks. Florence, a **sleek** black labrador, **wags** her tail.

Among the **cavalcade** of luggage passing beneath Florence's all-smelling nose, is a **nondescript** hardback suitcase. Inside the case, within **styrofoam** casing, packed in loose pepper and coffee, wrapped in **freezer** paper and heat-sealed in plastic, are 18 kilograms of hashish.

The cleverly **concealed** drugs don't fool super-**sniffer** Florence, and her persistent scratching at the case alerts her handler. Florence is one of a truly new breed: the product of what is perhaps the only project in the world dedicated to breeding dogs **solely** to detect drugs. Ordinary dogs have a 0.1% chance of making it in drug detection. The new breeding programme, run by the Australian Customs, is so successful that more than 50% of its dogs make the grade.

And what began as a wholly practical exercise in keeping illegal drugs out of Australia may end up playing a role in an entirely different **sphere** - the comparatively **esoteric** world of **neurobiology**. It turns out that it's not Florence's nose that makes her a top drug dog, but her **unswerving concentration**, plus a few other essential traits. Florence could help neurobiologists to understand both what they call 'attention processing', the brain mechanisms that determine what a person pays attention to and for how long, and its **flip side**, problems such as Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). As many as 3 to 5% of children are thought to suffer from the condition in the US, where the incidence is highest, although diagnosis is often **controversial**.

The Australian Customs has used dogs to find drugs since 1969. Traditionally, the animals came from pounds and private breeders. But, in 1993, **fed up with** the poor success rate of finding good dogs this way, John Vandeloo, senior instructor with the Detector Dog Unit, joined forces with Kath Champness, then a doctoral student at the University of Melbourne, and set up a breeding programme.

Champness began by defining six essential traits that make a detector dog. First, every good detector dog must love praise because this is the only tool trainers have at their disposal, but the dog must still be able to work for long periods without it. Then it needs a strong **hunting instinct** and the **stamina** to keep sniffing at the **taxing rate** of around 300 times per minute. The ideal detector is also fearless enough to deal with jam-packed airport crowds and the **roaring engine** rooms of **cargo ships**.


The remaining two traits are closely related and **cognitive** in nature. A good detector must be capable of focusing on the task of searching for drugs, despite the **distractions** in any airport or **dockside**. This is what neurobiologists call 'selective attention'. And finally, with potentially tens of thousands of hiding places for drugs, the dog must **persevere** and maintain focus for hours at a time. Neurobiologists call this '**sustained** attention'.

Vandeloo and Champness assess the dogs' abilities to concentrate by marking them on **a scale of between one and five** according to how well they remain focused on a toy **tossed** into a patch of grass. Ivan scores a **feeble** one. He follows the toy, gets half-way there, then becomes distracted by places where the other dogs have been or by flowers in the paddock. Rowena, on the other hand, has **phenomenal** concentration; some might even consider her **obsessive**. When Vandeloo tosses the toy, nothing can distract her from the searching, not other dogs, not food. And even if no one is around to encourage her, she keeps looking just the same. Rowena gets a five.

# Lack of sleep

One supporting piece of evidence for this rest-and-repair theory is that production of the growth hormone somatotropin, which helps tissue to regenerate, peaks while we are asleep.

Lack of sleep, however, can compromise the immune system, muddle thinking, cause depression, promote anxiety and encourage irritability.

It found that levels of their bodies' natural defences against viral infections had fallen significantly when measured the following morning

Researchers in San Diego deprived a group of men of sleep between 3 am and 7 am on just one night, and found that levels of their bodies' natural defences against viral infections had fallen significantly when measured the following morning.

In the next two stages, sleep gets progressively deeper. In stage four, usually reached after an hour, the slumber is so deep that, if awoken, the sleeper would be confused and disorientated.

In the fifth stage, the rapid eye movement (REM) stage, the heartbeat quickly gets back to normal levels, brain activity accelerates to daytime heights and above and the eyes move constantly beneath closed lids as if the sleeper is looking at something. During this stage, the body is almost paralysed.

Causes can be anything from pregnancy and stress to alcohol and heart disease. Smoking is a known handicap to sleep, with one survey showing that ex-smokers got to sleep in 18 minutes rather than their earlier average of 52.

Apart from self-help therapy such as regular exercise, there are psychological treatments, including relaxation training and therapy aimed at getting rid of pre-sleep worries and anxieties.

Medication is regarded by many as a last resort and often takes the form of sleeping pills, normally benzodiazepines, which are minor tranquillisers.

Professor Regelson advocates the use of melatonin for treating sleep disorders. Melatonin is a naturally secreted hormone, located in the pineal gland deep inside the brain.

He explains that it is sold in capsules, tablets, lozenges and mixed with herbs. It is not effective for all insomniacs, but many users have weaned themselves off sleeping tablets as a result of its application.
