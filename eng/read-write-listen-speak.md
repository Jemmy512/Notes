Dear Sir or Madam,

**I am writing with regard to** a flight that I missed due to a mistake by one of your employees.

Two weeks ago, I was due to catch a flight to London, where I intended to spend one week on holiday. Unfortunately, the attendant at the check-in desk gave me a boarding card for a different flight, and I did not notice the mistake until I arrived at the departure gate and it was too late.

As a result of the error, I was not allowed to board the flight to London, and this caused me great inconvenience. I had to book a new flight two days later, which meant I missed two days of my holiday and I spent an extra £300. That is all I would like to share. Thank you for your time.

As the mistake was caused by your company, I demand a full refund for my original flight, or a compensation for the additional flight. Also, I would like you to compensate for the taxi fares to and from the airport. I will have to take this matter further if the refund is not received in seven days.

I look forward to receiving your response.

Yours faithfully,
Jing

Dear Sir or Madam,

**I am writing with regard to** the proposed closure of the town’s sports and leisure center.

First, I would like to stress how important the center is for my own family. Our whole family use the gym on a daily basis, and my two children attend weekly football clubs, which they enjoy immensely.

I also believe that the leisure center is an essential part of the local community. It is where people go to do exercise, play sports, take part in group activities, and to socialize and make friends. It really is a social hub in the town.

If you do close the sports and leisure center, the local residents will lose a treasured facility. As there areno other sports centers within a reasonable distance, the closure would have a detrimental effect the quality of life in the area.

I sincerely hope that you will take these concerns into consideration and we would be so grateful if you can keep the center running.

Yours faithfully,
Jing

Dear Jennifer

I am writing to request some unpaid leave next month.

My parents’ 60th wedding anniversary is on March 21st, and they are planning to celebrate this significant achievement with all their children and grandchildren. To do this, they have rented a house bigenough to accommodate the whole family.

To participate in this special occasion, I would need to be away from work for four days, from Monday 19th to Thursday 23rd. My schedule for that week is relatively light, apart from two meetings with clients. Netta would be able to attend these in my place, as she has had previous dealings with both companies and knows the relevant staff there. I have no other urgent work commitments at that time.

I would be very grateful if you could allow me this time. These few days are very important to my parents and the whole family, and it would be a way to thank them for all the support they have given me.

Best wishes.
