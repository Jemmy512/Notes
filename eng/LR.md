The company’s **objective in** establishing a **formal dress code** is to enable our employees to **project the professional image** that is in keeping with the needs of our clients and customers who seek our guidance, input, and professional services.

Torn, dirty, or frayed clothing is unacceptable.

No dress code can cover all **contingencies** so employees must **exert** a certain amount of judgement in their choice of clothing to wear to work.

If you **experience uncertainty**, please ask your supervisor for advice.

**Conservative walking shoes, dress shoes, loafers, boots, flats, drness heels, and backless shoes** are acceptable for work. Not wearing **stockings or socks** is inappropriate. Tennis shoes and any shoe with an open **toe** are not acceptable in the office.

The wearing of **ties, scarves, belts, and jewellery** is encouraged, provided they are tasteful, Items which are **flashy** should be avoided.

A professional appearance is encouraged and excessive makeup is unprofessional. Remember that some employees may have **allergic reactions** to the chemicals in **perfumes** and **makeup**, so wear these substances **in moderation**.


# Flying

For many enthusiasts, the ultimate flight **fantasy** is the jet pack, a small piece of equipment on your back which enables you to climb vertically into the air and fly forwards, backwards and turn.

The trouble is that paramotoring is **ill-suited** to **commuting** because of the impossibility of **taking off** in strong winds, ’ says Clarke.

Another keen paramotorist recently experienced a **close call** when in the air.


After an inspection of the engine later, I noticed that the **exhaust** pipe had moved during the flight and the **harness** had started **melting**.

You may pick up cheaper equipment **secondhand**, however. There was one pre-used kit advertised on a website, with a bit of damage to the **cage** and **tips of the propellers** due to a **rough landing**.

Fun though it is, paramotoring is not **in the same league** as the **acrobatics** demonstrated by Yves Rossy.

He once **parachuted** from a plane above Lake Geneva and, **intentionally skimming** the top of a **fountain** as he landed, he descended to the lake where he grabbed some water ski equipment and started waterskiing while the crowd watched open-mouthed.

**Ever since** management expert Peter Drucker compared the job of Chief Executive Officer to that of an **orchestra conductor**, the business world has been exploring **comparisons** and inspirations from the world of music

Now Warwick Business School Professors Deniz Ucbasaran and Andy Lockett are **hitting all the right notes with** their study of famous jazz musicians

For a start, jazz bands are **synonymous** with creativity, improvisation and innovation, all essential **ingredients** for entrepreneurship

Jazz groups and their members often operate in uncertain and dynamic environments, characterised by rapid change.
> "characterised by rapid change" is a participial phrase that modifies the prepositional phrase "in uncertain and dynamic environments" and indicates how those environments are.

Yet through **collective endeavour** many jazz bands find their own structure and **harmony** and become profitable enterprises - both creatively and commercially.

**Trumpet** player Miles Davis was **instrumental** in the development of a number of new jazz styles, including bebop and jazz **fusion**. Jazz **drummer** Arthur 'Art' Blakey became famous **as the leader of** his band the Jazz Messengers.

That feature was **as much bound up with** the personality of the individual musician **as** it was to do with their technical **proficiency**.

But **disparate** teams, many different personalities, and high levels of creativity are a **recipe** for group conflict.

And, **sure enough**, there was plenty of dysfunctional conflict and **disruptive** **clashes** of **egos** and personalities evident in the jazz ensembles.
> "evident in the jazz ensembles" is a prepositional phrase that modifies the subject complement and indicates where the dysfunctional conflict and clashes of egos and personalities were evident.

Traditional team leadership theory suggests that to get the best team performance the leader should **foster** conflict that **is productive in its effects**, while minimising destructive conflict.

So how do leaders deal with destructive conflict? It **didn't seem to bother the likes** of Ellington, Davis and Blakey.

The moments of musical genius when everything came together excused minor problems such as if individuals occasionally turned up late for practice, or stepped out of a performance for a quick snack.
> "excused" is the verb of the sentence, indicating what the moments of musical genius did.

Instead, these leaders acted more as **facilitators**, empowering the musicians to collectively coordinate their behaviour and action to produce the **desired outcome**.

All three leaders created a general framework within which team members could work, providing guidance but also the freedom to explore, express and make mistakes.

Yet the high turnover of team members, despite the **resulting**(adj) loss of knowledge and skills, was seen in a **positive light**. That was partly because of the advantages of **getting a fresh shot of** knowledge, ideas and creativity when new members joined.

# Tree

Whereas now it is the wood of the kauri which is an important natural resource, in the past it was the tree’s **sap** (the **thick** liquid which flows inside a tree) which, when hardened into gum, played an important role in New Zealand’s early history.

After running from **rips** or **tears** in the **bark** of trees, the sap **hardens** to form the **lumps** of gum which eventually fall to the ground and are buried under layers of forest **litter**. The bark often splits where branches fork from the **trunk**, and gum accumulates there also.

This gum came in a **bewildering** variety of colours, degree of transparency and hardness, depending on the length and location of **burial**, **as well as** the health of the original tree and the area of the **bleeding**.

Lowest quality gum was soft, black or **chalky** and **sugary** and was usually found buried in **swamps**, where it had been **in contact with** water for a long time.

Long periods in the sun or **bush** fires could transform **dull**, **cloudy** lumps into higher quality transparent gum.

Kauri gum burns **readily** and was used by Maori people to light fires. Sometimes it was bound in **grass**, **ignited** and used as a **torch** by night fishermen to attract fish.

The first kauri gum to be exported from New Zealand was part of a **cargo** taken back to Australia and England by two early **expeditions** in 1814 and 1815.

As the surface gum became more **scarce**, **spades** were used to dig up the buried **treasure**.

During **times of economic difficulty**, gum-digging was the only job available where **the unemployed** from many **walks of life** could **earn a living**, if they were prepared to work.
> walk of life: used to refer to the job you do or the part of society you belong to

The first major commercial use of kauri gum was in the manufacture of **high-grade furniture varnish**, a kind of clear paint used to treat wood.

Fossil kauri gum is rather soft and can be **carved** easily with a knife or **polished** with fine **sandpaper**.

Many of the gum-diggers enjoyed the occasional **spell** of **carving** and produced a wide variety of small **sculptured** pieces.
> spell: a magic power produced by speaking a set of words or taking a specific set of actions
